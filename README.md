### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex Mulrooney and I am a junior EE major (with CS and Math minors) at the University of Delaware. 

I'm currently taking classes in statisical learning, convex optimization, digital signal processing, and more. I'm also working on research on applying contrastive learning to fine tune neural networks using human fMRI data to make them more predictive of the brain, as well as contributing to an open source Julia tensor decomposition package.
