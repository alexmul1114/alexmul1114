### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex Mulrooney and I am a sophomore EE major at the University of Delaware. 

I'm currently taking classes in data structures, optimization, circuits, embedded systems, and solid state electronics. I'm also working on research on applying fMRI data to SVM image classifiers to see if the brain data can be used to improve image classifier performace.
