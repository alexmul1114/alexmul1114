### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex Mulrooney and I am a freshman EE major/CS minor at the University of Delaware. 

I'm currently taking classes in data science, systems programming, and digital design. I'm also working on resarch with the OpenBCI Cyton EEG headest under the direction of Dr. Austin Brockmeier.
